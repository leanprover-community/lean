Consider a type `ψ` which is an inductive datatype using a single constructor `mk (a : α) (b : β) : ψ`.
Lean will automatically make two projection functions `a : ψ → α`, `b : ψ → β`.
Lean tags these declarations as __projections__.
This helps the simplifier / rewriter not have to expand projectors.
Eg `a (mk x y)` will automatically reduce to `x`.
If you `extend` a structure, all of the projections on the parent will also be created for the child.
Projections are also treated differently in the VM for efficiency.

Note that projections have nothing to do with the dot `mylist.map` syntax.

You can find out if a declaration is a projection using `environment.is_projection` which returns `projection_info`.

Data for a projection declaration:
- `cname`    is the name of the constructor associated with the projection.
- `nparams`  is the number of constructor parameters. Eg `and.intro` has two type parameters.
- `idx`      is the parameter being projected by this projection.
- `is_class` is tt iff this is a typeclass projection.

### Examples:

- `and.right` is a projection with ``{cname := `and.intro, nparams := 2, idx := 1, is_class := ff}``
- `ordered_ring.neg` is a projection with ``{cname := `ordered_ring.mk, nparams := 1, idx := 5, is_class := tt}``.

  This has the same effect as a `inductive` in the file, including generating
  all the auxiliary definitions, as well as triggering mutual/nested inductive
  compilation, by contrast to `environment.add_inductive` which only adds the
  core axioms supported by the kernel.

  The `inds` argument should be a list of inductives in the mutual family.
  The first argument is a pair of the name of the type being constructed
  and the type of this inductive family (not including the params).
  The second argument is a list of intro rules, specified by a name, an
  `implicit_infer_kind` giving the implicitness of the params for this constructor,
  and an expression with the type of the constructor (not including the params).

Technically, this works by checking if the name is in the ginductive environment
extension which is outside the kernel, whereas `is_inductive` works by looking at the kernel extension.
But there are no `is_inductive`s which are not `is_ginductive`.
