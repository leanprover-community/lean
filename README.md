Installation
------------

If you want to use Lean, the recommended way to install Lean is following [these instructions under Regular install](https://leanprover-community.github.io/get_started.html#regular-install).

If you want to modify the code of Lean or the core library, the recommended way is to [build Lean from source](doc/make/index.md).

If you want to modify *a single file* in the core library (not the C++ source), then instead of building Lean from scratch, you can run (in your local `lean/` directory)
```
git checkout v3.xx.x
git checkout -b my-branch-name
elan override set leanprover-community-lean-3.xx.x
```
You can now build the core library with `lean --make library` or open any Lean file is VSCode / Emacs and it will use the version of Lean you specified. You might have to restart Lean (in VScode: `ctrl+shift+P Lean: Restart`). Warning: all imported Lean files will be from the downloaded community version, *not* the version of the files in this repository. Therefore, this setup is not recommended if you modify more than one file. Moreover, editor features like `Go to Definition` will not behave correctly with this setup. For the best experience, [build Lean from source](doc/make/index.md).

Stable binary releases of Lean are available on the [release page](https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean/releases).
Nightly binary releases are available on the [nightly release page](https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean-nightly/releases).
